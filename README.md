## Overview
This project aims to use WiFi signals, specifically Channel State Information ([CSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_state_information)), to monitor heart rate and respiration rate. 
Leveraging the IEEE 802.11n WiFi standard, which includes MIMO and OFDM technologies, we will capture detailed signal information through CSI. 
By inputting CSI data into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we aim to detect vital signs by analyzing changes in subcarrier signal strengths. 
Despite challenges such as dataset assumptions and signal noise, the goal is to develop a technology that can be integrated into smartphones and home routers for non-invasive health monitoring.
